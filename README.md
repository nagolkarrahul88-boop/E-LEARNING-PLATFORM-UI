#DESCRIPTION
E‑Learning Web Application
Project Overview
The E‑Learning Website is a web‑based educational platform designed to provide structured online learning for beginners in web development. The primary objective of this project is to allow users to learn technical courses such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in an organized, interactive, and user‑friendly manner. This platform simulates a real‑world online learning system where learners can enroll in courses, track their progress, attempt assessments, and earn certificates upon successful completion.
This project was developed as part of my internship to gain hands‑on experience in front‑end web development, understand application flow, and implement real‑world features using core web technologies without relying heavily on frameworks.
Key Features of the Website
User Authentication System
The website includes a simple login system to allow users to securely access courses. Once logged in, the session is maintained using browser storage, ensuring a smooth user experience.
Course Management Module
The platform provides multiple courses such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Each course is divided into chapters, allowing users to learn step‑by‑step. A course dashboard displays all available courses along with their completion progress.
Progress Tracking
User progress is tracked using localStorage. As users complete chapters, the progress bar updates dynamically. Course completion percentage reflects both lesson completion and assessment results, similar to professional e‑learning platforms.
Assessment System
Each course has a dedicated assessment page. Questions are dynamically loaded based on the selected course. The assessment includes:
Multiple‑choice questions
Automatic validation of answers
Pass/fail logic based on score percentage
Limited number of attempts per day
Attempt Control Logic
To simulate real examination conditions, the assessment system restricts the number of attempts a user can take in one day. If attempts are exhausted, the user must wait until the next day, which is calculated using timestamps.
Certificate Generation
Once a user successfully passes an assessment, a certificate becomes available. The certificate dynamically displays:
User name
Course name
Completion date
The certificate can also be printed or downloaded, making it suitable for professional use.
Logout Functionality
A logout button is provided on the course pages, allowing users to exit the session without manually closing browser tabs. This improves usability and security.
Technologies and Tools Used
HTML5
Used to structure the website content including forms, headers, buttons, and assessment questions.
CSS3
Used for styling the application with a modern, clean, and professional user interface. Responsive design techniques were applied to ensure compatibility across different screen sizes.
JavaScript (Vanilla JS)
JavaScript plays a major role in the project. It is used for:
Dynamic question rendering
Progress calculation
Assessment logic
Local storage handling
Certificate visibility control
Event handling and DOM manipulation
Browser LocalStorage
Used to store user progress, assessment attempts, login state, and certificate status without using a backend database.
Visual Studio Code
Used as the primary code editor for development.
Web Browser (Chrome)
Used for testing, debugging, and validating the application behavior.
Learning Outcomes
Through this project, I gained practical experience in:
Structuring real‑world web applications
Writing clean and reusable JavaScript code
Managing application state without backend support
Implementing user‑centric UI/UX design
Debugging logical and styling issues
Understanding how e‑learning platforms function internally
Conclusion
The E‑Learning Website project demonstrates my ability to design and develop a complete front‑end web application using core technologies. It reflects practical knowledge of web development concepts and problem‑solving skills required in a professional environment. This project has significantly enhanced my understanding of how educational platforms work and has prepared me for real‑world development challenges during my internship.
